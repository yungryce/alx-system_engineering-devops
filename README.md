## Repository Overview

This repository contains projects completed as part of the ALX System Engineering & DevOps curriculum. The curriculum provides comprehensive training in shell scripting, system administration, networking, web infrastructure design, and DevOps methodologies. The projects progress from basic shell concepts to complex infrastructure design and automation, preparing students for roles in system administration, site reliability engineering, and DevOps.

## Learning Path

The curriculum follows a progressive learning path:

1. **Shell Basics & Scripting**: Fundamentals of shell navigation, file manipulation, permissions, redirections, variables, and scripting with control structures
2. **System Administration**: Process management, signals, SSH, web servers, configuration management, and debugging
3. **Networking**: Fundamentals of networking, OSI model, TCP/IP, DNS, and network protocols
4. **Web Infrastructure**: Design and optimization of web stacks, load balancing, SSL/TLS, firewalls, and monitoring
5. **DevOps Practices**: Configuration management, automation, monitoring, and continuous integration/deployment concepts
