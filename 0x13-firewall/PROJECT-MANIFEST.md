## System Context
This component covers network security through the implementation of firewalls, specifically using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Linux servers. Firewalls are essential for protecting servers from unauthorized access and network-based attacks by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules.

## Development Requirements
- Linux/Unix-based Operating System
- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- Administrative Access (sudo/root)
- Text Editor (vi/vim/emacs)
- Shell Scripting Knowledge
- Networking Fundamentals Understanding
- Security Protocol Knowledge
- Service Port Requirements Information

## Development Workflow
1. Read project specifications and requirements
2. Install firewall software (UFW)
3. Set default policies (deny incoming, allow outgoing)
4. Configure specific port allowances for essential services
5. Implement port forwarding for required services
6. Test firewall rules for proper functionality
7. Verify secure access to permitted services
8. Document implementation details and configurations
9. Submit for automated and peer review

## Maintenance Notes
- All scripts use appropriate shebang lines where applicable
- Each script includes comments explaining functionality
- Scripts have proper execution permissions
- Firewall configurations follow security best practices
- Essential service ports (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS) are properly allowed
- Default policies enforce "deny by default" security model
- Port forwarding configurations maintain proper security context
- Firewall should be automatically enabled at system boot

## Implementation Specifics

### Basic Firewall Configuration
- **Traffic Filtering**: [0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but](./0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but)
  * Installs UFW on the server
  * Sets default deny policy for incoming traffic
  * Sets default allow policy for outgoing traffic
  * Allows SSH (port 22) for remote administration
  * Allows HTTP (port 80) for web traffic
  * Allows HTTPS (port 443) for secure web traffic
  * Enables the firewall with the new configuration

### Advanced Firewall Features
- **Port Forwarding**: [100-port_forwarding](./100-port_forwarding)
  * Configures forwarding of external traffic to internal services
  * Implements Network Address Translation (NAT)
  * Redirects traffic for specific protocols and ports
  * Maintains security while enabling complex network topologies
