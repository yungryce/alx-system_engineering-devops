## System Context
This component implements comprehensive monitoring for web infrastructure, providing visibility into both server metrics and application performance to ensure reliability, optimize resource usage, and enable proactive issue detection before they impact users.

## Development Requirements
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Operating System
- Datadog Account (US1 Region)
- Web Server (Apache/Nginx)
- Access to Server Configuration
- Datadog API/Application Keys
- Root or Sudo Access
- Web Infrastructure Components
- Knowledge of System Metrics

## Development Workflow
1. Sign up for Datadog and obtain API credentials
2. Install Datadog agent on target servers
3. Configure the agent to collect appropriate metrics
4. Set up specific monitors for key performance indicators
5. Create custom dashboards for metric visualization
6. Configure appropriate alerting thresholds
7. Validate monitoring data collection
8. Document monitoring configuration

## Maintenance Notes
- Datadog agent should run as a service and start on boot
- API keys should be stored securely and never exposed publicly
- Dashboards should be organized by function (system, application, etc.)
- Alerts should be configured with appropriate notification channels
- Dashboard IDs should be documented for reference
- Regular review of metrics collected to ensure relevance
- Monitor for false positives and tune alert thresholds accordingly

## Implementation Specifics

### Datadog Configuration
- **Dashboard Configuration**: [2-setup_datadog](./2-setup_datadog)
