## System Context
This component builds on basic web stack debugging skills to address more specific network service issues. It focuses on port configuration problems in Nginx, which is a common challenge in web server deployment. Understanding how to diagnose and fix port binding issues is essential for maintaining reliable web infrastructure.

## Development Requirements
- Linux/Unix-based Operating System
- Nginx Web Server
- curl Command-Line Tool
- netstat/ss Network Utilities
- Text Editor (vi/vim/emacs)
- Shell Scripting Knowledge
- Basic Understanding of HTTP and Networking

## Development Workflow
1. Read project specifications and requirements
2. Identify symptoms of the port binding issue
3. Analyze Nginx configuration files and their relationships
4. Examine server connectivity with network tools
5. Develop a hypothesis for the root cause
6. Implement a fix through shell commands
7. Validate the solution by testing server responses
8. Optimize the solution for brevity and efficiency
9. Document the debugging process and solution
10. Submit for automated and peer review

## Maintenance Notes
- All scripts use appropriate shebang lines
- Each script includes a comment describing its functionality
- Scripts have proper execution permissions
- Solutions prioritize simplicity and minimal changes
- Both standard and optimized solutions are provided
- Scripts are idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)
- Documentation clearly explains the issue and solution

## Implementation Specifics

### Nginx Port 80 Configuration Fix
- **Standard Solution**: [0-nginx_likes_port_80](./0-nginx_likes_port_80)
  * Fixes Nginx to listen on port 80
  * Removes incorrect symbolic link
  * Creates proper link from sites-available to sites-enabled
  * Restarts the Nginx service

### Optimized Solution
- **Shorter Implementation**: [1-debugging_made_short](./1-debugging_made_short)
  * Accomplishes the same fix with fewer commands
  * Uses symbolic link creation directly
  * Employs advanced process management for service control
  * Demonstrates concise problem-solving techniques
