# Project Manifest: Web Stack Debugging #2

## Project Identity
- **Name**: Web Stack Debugging #2
- **Type**: Educational
- **Scope**: Server Security and Privilege Management
- **Status**: Completed

## Technology Signature
- **Core**: Bash Shell Scripting
- **Environment**: Ubuntu
- **Web Server**: Nginx
- **Process Management**: Service Control, Process Ownership
- **System Security**: User Permissions, Privilege De-escalation
- **Debugging Tools**: Process Monitoring, Log Analysis

## Demonstrated Competencies
- Web Server Security Hardening
- Privilege De-escalation Configuration
- Non-root Service Management
- User Permission Management
- Configuration File Modification
- Process Ownership Control
- Nginx Configuration Expertise
- Port Binding Conflict Resolution
- Script Optimization Techniques
- Security Best Practices Application
- System Process Management
- Root Cause Analysis
- Service Dependency Handling
- Shell Scripting for System Administration

## System Context
This component builds on previous web stack debugging skills to address security concerns by implementing the principle of least privilege. Running web services as non-root users is a critical security practice that helps mitigate potential security breaches by limiting the damage that could occur if a service is compromised.

## Development Requirements
- Linux/Unix-based Operating System
- Nginx Web Server
- Text Editor (vi/vim/emacs)
- Shell Scripting Knowledge
- Understanding of Linux Users and Permissions
- Process Management Tools (ps, kill, etc.)
- Service Management Commands
- Sudo or Root Access for Initial Configuration

## Development Workflow
1. Read project specifications and requirements
2. Identify the security issue (Nginx running as root)
3. Analyze current configuration and permissions
4. Develop a strategy for running Nginx as a non-root user
5. Implement configuration changes through shell scripting
6. Handle service conflicts (Apache using required ports)
7. Test the solution to ensure web server functionality
8. Optimize the solution for conciseness and efficiency
9. Document the debugging process and solution
10. Submit for automated and peer review

## Maintenance Notes
- All scripts use appropriate shebang lines
- Each script includes comments explaining functionality
- Scripts have proper execution permissions
- Changes maintain web server functionality while improving security
- Configuration modifications are minimal but effective
- Scripts are idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)
- Solutions follow the principle of least privilege
- Optimized version maintains functionality with fewer lines of code

## Implementation Specifics

### Nginx User Configuration
- **Running as Non-root**: [1-run_nginx_as_nginx](./1-run_nginx_as_nginx)
  * Configures Nginx to run as the nginx user
  * Sets appropriate file permissions
  * Configures port binding correctly
  * Handles service conflicts with Apache
  * Ensures web server restarts properly with new settings

### Optimized Solution
- **Compact Implementation**: [100-fix_in_7_lines_or_less](./100-fix_in_7_lines_or_less)
  * Achieves the same security improvement in 7 lines or less
  * Demonstrates script optimization techniques
  * Maintains all critical functionality
  * Showcases efficient shell scripting practices
