# Project Manifest: Web Stack Debugging #3

## Project Identity
- **Name**: Web Stack Debugging #3
- **Type**: Educational
- **Scope**: WordPress Debugging with strace
- **Status**: Completed

## Technology Signature
- **Core**: Puppet, strace
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- **Web Stack**: LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- **Application**: WordPress
- **Automation**: Puppet
- **Diagnostics**: System Call Tracing

## Demonstrated Competencies
- System Call Tracing And Analysis
- Web Server Error Diagnosis
- WordPress Configuration Troubleshooting
- Apache Error Identification
- Puppet Manifest Creation
- File Content Manipulation
- Pattern Replacement Automation
- Configuration Management
- Error Code 500 Resolution
- LAMP Stack Debugging
- Systematic Problem Solving
- Infrastructure As Code Implementation

## System Context
This component demonstrates advanced debugging techniques for web applications by using system call tracing to identify a configuration issue in a WordPress installation, then creating an automated solution using Puppet for consistent and repeatable application of the fix.

## Development Requirements
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Operating System
- strace Diagnostic Tool
- Puppet 3.4 Configuration Management
- WordPress Installation
- LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- Apache Web Server
- Access to System Logs
- Root or Sudo Access

## Development Workflow
1. Identify the HTTP 500 error in the WordPress application
2. Use strace to monitor system calls made by the Apache process
3. Analyze the traced output for file operation failures
4. Identify the misconfiguration in the PHP/WordPress files
5. Create a Puppet manifest to automate the fix
6. Test the solution to verify error resolution
7. Ensure the fix is repeatable and automated

## Maintenance Notes
- Puppet manifests must pass puppet-lint version 2.1.1 without errors
- Puppet manifest files must end with a new line
- Puppet manifests first line must be a comment explaining what the manifest is about
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- The fix addresses a common typo in WordPress configurations
- Always test configuration changes before applying to production
- Monitor Apache error logs for recurrence of issues
