## System Context
This component provides database services for web applications with high availability needs. By implementing MySQL primary-replica replication, it addresses single points of failure in database infrastructure, ensuring service continuity even if a database server fails. The backup strategy further protects against data loss scenarios.

## Development Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Environment
- MySQL 5.7.x Installation
- Root/Sudo Access to Servers
- Database Administration Knowledge
- Networking Configuration Access
- Shell Scripting Capabilities
- Text Editor (vi/vim/emacs)
- Database Design Understanding
- Backup Storage Space

## Development Workflow
1. Install MySQL on primary and replica servers
2. Configure user accounts and permissions
3. Create required databases and tables
4. Configure primary MySQL server for replication
5. Configure replica MySQL server
6. Establish replication between servers
7. Verify replication functionality
8. Implement automated backup strategy
9. Test backups and restoration procedures
10. Document configuration and maintenance procedures

## Maintenance Notes
- All MySQL configuration files use appropriate syntax and best practices
- Server IDs are properly configured to be unique
- Binary logging is enabled for replication and point-in-time recovery
- Bash scripts include proper shebang and comments
- Scripts have proper execution permissions
- Backup scripts implement proper naming conventions
- Replication is set to track specific databases
- Security considerations are implemented in MySQL configurations
- Database user permissions follow principle of least privilege

## Implementation Specifics

### MySQL Primary Server Configuration
- **Primary Config**: [4-mysql_configuration_primary](./4-mysql_configuration_primary)
  * Unique server ID configuration
  * Binary logging enabled
  * Specific database replication
  * Network access configuration
  * Security settings implementation

### MySQL Replica Server Configuration
- **Replica Config**: [4-mysql_configuration_replica](./4-mysql_configuration_replica)
  * Unique server ID (different from primary)
  * Replication source configuration
  * Read-only settings for data consistency
  * Relay log configuration
  * Database replication targets

### Database Backup Strategy
- **Backup Script**: [5-mysql_backup](./5-mysql_backup)
  * Full database dump generation
  * Timestamp-based backup naming
  * Compression for storage efficiency
  * Parametrized password input
  * Archive creation for portability
