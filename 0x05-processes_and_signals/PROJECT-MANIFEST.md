# Project Manifest: Processes and Signals

## Project Identity
- **Name**: Processes and Signals
- **Type**: Educational
- **Scope**: Process Management and Signal Handling
- **Status**: Completed

## Technology Signature
- **Core**: Bash Shell
- **Environment**: Unix/Linux
- **Verification Tools**: ShellCheck
- **Style Guide**: Shell Script Standards
- **Process Control**: Signal Handling

## Demonstrated Competencies
- Process Creation and Termination
- Process Identification and Enumeration
- Signal Generation and Handling
- Background Process Management
- Daemon Process Implementation
- Graceful Shutdown Procedures
- PID and PPID Understanding
- Process State Monitoring
- Job Control Operations
- Inter-Process Communication
- Process Resource Management

## System Context
This component builds upon shell scripting knowledge to introduce the concepts of process management and signal handling, enabling students to monitor, control, and automate system processes for effective system administration and application management.

## Development Requirements
- Linux/Unix-based Operating System
- Bash Shell
- Text Editor (vi/vim/emacs)
- Process Management Tools (ps, top, kill)
- ShellCheck for Script Verification
- Signal Handling Understanding

## Development Workflow
1. Read project specifications and requirements
2. Design script logic with appropriate process control mechanisms
3. Implement solutions as Bash scripts
4. Make scripts executable (chmod +x)
5. Test scripts in a Linux environment
6. Validate with ShellCheck
7. Submit for automated and peer review

## Maintenance Notes
- All scripts use the shebang line (#!/usr/bin/env bash)
- Each script includes a comment describing its functionality
- Scripts have proper execution permissions
- Commands follow standard shell syntax and conventions
- Scripts are optimized for readability and maintainability
- All scripts are verified with ShellCheck for best practices
- Signal handling is implemented for proper process termination
