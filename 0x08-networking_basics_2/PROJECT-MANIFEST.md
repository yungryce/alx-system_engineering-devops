# Project Manifest: Networking Basics 2

## Project Identity
- **Name**: Networking Basics 2
- **Type**: Educational
- **Scope**: Advanced Networking Concepts
- **Status**: Completed

## Technology Signature
- **Core**: Bash Shell
- **Environment**: Unix/Linux
- **Verification Tools**: ShellCheck
- **Style Guide**: Shell Script Standards
- **Network Tools**: ifconfig, netcat, ping

## Demonstrated Competencies
- Localhost Configuration
- Host File Management
- IP Address Configuration
- Network Interface Management
- Port Listening Implementation
- DNS Resolution Understanding
- Network Service Creation
- Network Connectivity Verification
- Loopback Interface Comprehension
- IP Address Binding
- Network Socket Communication
- Local Resolution Customization

## System Context
This component builds upon the fundamental networking concepts introduced in the previous module, providing more advanced techniques for network configuration, communication, and service implementation that are essential for server administration and network management.

## Development Requirements
- Linux/Unix-based Operating System
- Bash Shell
- Text Editor (vi/vim/emacs)
- Network Utilities (ifconfig, ping, netcat)
- Root/sudo access for configuration changes
- Networking Knowledge
- IP Configuration Understanding

## Development Workflow
1. Read project specifications and requirements
2. Design network configurations and services
3. Implement solutions as Bash scripts
4. Make scripts executable (chmod +x)
5. Test scripts in a Linux environment
6. Validate with ShellCheck
7. Submit for automated and peer review

## Maintenance Notes
- All scripts use the shebang line (#!/usr/bin/env bash)
- Each script includes a comment describing its functionality
- Scripts have proper execution permissions
- Commands follow standard shell syntax and conventions
- Scripts are optimized for readability and maintainability
- All scripts are verified with ShellCheck for best practices
- Some scripts require root privileges to execute properly

## Implementation Specifics

### Localhost and IP Management
- **Change Localhost**: [0-change_your_home_IP](./0-change_your_home_IP)
- **Show Attached IPs**: [1-show_attached_IPs](./1-show_attached_IPs)

### Network Services
- **Port Listening**: [100-port_listening_on_localhost](./100-port_listening_on_localhost)
