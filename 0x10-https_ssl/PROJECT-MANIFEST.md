## System Context
This component builds on load balancing and web server knowledge to implement security through HTTPS and SSL/TLS. Secure web infrastructure is critical for protecting data in transit between clients and servers, maintaining privacy, ensuring data integrity, and establishing trust with users. This module addresses the essential skills for encrypting web traffic in modern web applications.

## Development Requirements
- Linux/Unix-based Operating System
- HAProxy Load Balancer
- Access to DNS Management
- SSL/TLS Certificates
- Domain Name
- Text Editor (vi/vim/emacs)
- Shell Scripting Knowledge
- DNS Tools (dig)
- Text Processing Tools (awk, grep)
- Basic Cryptography Understanding

## Development Workflow
1. Read project specifications and requirements
2. Configure domain and subdomain DNS records
3. Obtain SSL/TLS certificates
4. Configure HAProxy for SSL termination
5. Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirection
6. Develop shell scripts for domain analysis
7. Test secure connections and certificate validity
8. Verify subdomain configurations
9. Document implementation details and configurations
10. Submit for automated and peer review

## Maintenance Notes
- All scripts use appropriate shebang lines
- Each script includes comments explaining functionality
- Scripts have proper execution permissions
- HAProxy configurations follow security best practices
- SSL certificates require regular renewal (typically every 90 days)
- DNS configurations require monitoring for proper resolution
- Security configurations adhere to modern encryption standards
- Scripts are idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)

## Implementation Specifics

### Domain Management
- **Subdomain Analysis**: [0-world_wide_web](./0-world_wide_web)
  * Displays information about domain and subdomains
  * Analyzes DNS records using dig command
  * Extracts record type and destination information
  * Supports specific subdomain queries or default analysis

### SSL Implementation
- **HAProxy SSL Termination**: [1-haproxy_ssl_termination](./1-haproxy_ssl_termination)
  * Configures HAProxy with SSL certificates
  * Implements secure frontend listening on port 443
  * Sets up backend web servers
  * Establishes proper SSL ciphers and options
  * Handles HTTPS traffic securely

### Security Enhancement
- **HTTP to HTTPS Redirection**: [100-redirect_http_to_https](./100-redirect_http_to_https)
  * Forces all HTTP traffic to redirect to HTTPS
  * Ensures all connections use encrypted transport
  * Maintains compatibility with legacy clients
  * Implements security best practices
