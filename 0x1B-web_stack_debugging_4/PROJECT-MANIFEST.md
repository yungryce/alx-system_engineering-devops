## Project Identity
- **Name**: Web Stack Debugging #4
- **Type**: Educational
- **Scope**: Performance Optimization and Debugging
- **Status**: Completed

## Technology Signature
- **Core**: Puppet
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- **Web Server**: Nginx
- **Verification Tools**: ApacheBench, puppet-lint
- **Style Guide**: Puppet Style Guide
- **Configuration Management**: Infrastructure as Code

## Demonstrated Competencies
- Root Cause Analysis
- Web Stack Performance Tuning
- Puppet Manifest Development
- System Resource Optimization
- Linux Limits Configuration
- Nginx Performance Optimization
- Benchmarking and Performance Testing
- Critical Service Configuration
- Resource Limitation Management
- Infrastructure as Code Implementation
- Automated Configuration Management
- User-level System Resource Management

## System Context
This component focuses on debugging and optimizing web stack performance issues by identifying bottlenecks and implementing permanent fixes using Puppet as an infrastructure as code solution. It addresses both application-level configurations (Nginx) and system-level parameters (file descriptor limits).

## Development Requirements
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Puppet 3.4.x
- puppet-lint 2.1.1
- ApacheBench (benchmarking tool)
- Text Editor (vi/vim/emacs)
- Understanding of Nginx configuration
- Knowledge of Linux system limits

## Development Workflow
1. Identify performance issues through benchmarking
2. Analyze system and application configurations
3. Determine root causes of bottlenecks
4. Develop Puppet manifests to implement fixes
5. Test fixes with appropriate benchmarking tools
6. Verify resolution of issues
7. Document the debugging process and solutions
8. Validate Puppet manifests with puppet-lint

## Maintenance Notes
- All Puppet manifests include clear comments
- Each task is documented in the README.md
- Solutions focus on addressing root causes rather than symptoms
- Configuration changes are fully automated through Puppet
- Manifests pass puppet-lint validation
- Solutions are tested for effectiveness under load

## Implementation Specifics

### Performance Optimization
- **Nginx Worker Connections**: [0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp](./0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp)
  - Increases ULIMIT from 15 to 4096 connections
  - Restart Nginx service to apply changes
  - Eliminates failed requests under high load

### System Configuration
- **OS User Limits**: [1-user_limit.pp](./1-user_limit.pp)
  - Increases soft file limit to 10000 for holberton user
  - Increases hard file limit to 100000 for holberton user
  - Resolves "too many open files" errors during login
