## Project Overview

This repository provides an introduction to shell redirections and filters in Unix-like operating systems. It focuses on understanding and mastering input/output stream manipulation, text processing utilities, pattern matching, and command chaining to efficiently handle and transform data through shell commands.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

* What the shell I/O redirections are and how they work
* How to redirect standard output to a file or another command
* How to get standard input from a file instead of the keyboard
* How to send the output from one program to the input of another
* How to combine commands and filters with redirections
* What special characters are and how to escape them
* How to use common text processing commands like `head`, `tail`, `find`, `grep`, etc.
* How to use advanced filters for data manipulation

## Requirements

* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All scripts must pass Shellcheck verification
* The first line of all Bash scripts should be `#!/bin/bash`
* All files must be executable (`chmod +x filename`)
* No use of backticks, &&, || or ; in scripts
* All scripts must be exactly two lines long (the shebang and one command)

## Standard Streams

In Unix/Linux systems, there are three standard streams for input/output operations:

1. **Standard Input (stdin)**: The default source of input for commands, typically the keyboard.

2. **Standard Output (stdout)**: The default destination for command output, typically the terminal.

3. **Standard Error (stderr)**: The default destination for error messages, typically the terminal.

Each stream is associated with a file descriptor:
- stdin: file descriptor 0
- stdout: file descriptor 1
- stderr: file descriptor 2

## Redirection Operators

Shell redirections allow you to control where input comes from and where output goes to. Here are the most common redirection operators:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `>`      | Redirects stdout to a file (overwrites) | `ls > files.txt` |
| `>>`     | Appends stdout to a file | `echo "text" >> log.txt` |
| `<`      | Redirects stdin from a file | `sort < unsorted.txt` |
| `2>`     | Redirects stderr to a file | `find / -name "file" 2> errors.log` |
| `2>&1`   | Redirects stderr to stdout | `command > all.log 2>&1` |
| `&>`     | Redirects both stdout and stderr to a file (Bash 4+) | `command &> all.log` |
| `<>`     | Opens a file for both reading and writing | `exec 3<> file.txt` |
| `<<<`    | Here-string (redirects a string as stdin) | `grep "pattern" <<< "text"` |
| `<<`     | Here-document (multiline input) | `cat << EOF` |

## Command Pipelines with '|'

The pipe operator (`|`) connects the stdout of one command to the stdin of another. This allows you to create powerful command chains:

```bash
command1 | command2 | command3
```

For example:

```bash
cat file.txt | grep "pattern" | sort | uniq > result.txt
```

This pipeline:
1. Outputs the content of file.txt
2. Finds lines containing "pattern"
3. Sorts the matching lines
4. Removes duplicate lines
5. Saves the result to result.txt

## Common Text Processing Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `cat`   | Concatenate and display files | `cat file.txt` |
| `head`  | Display the beginning of a file | `head -n 5 file.txt` |
| `tail`  | Display the end of a file | `tail -n 10 file.txt` |
| `grep`  | Search for patterns in text | `grep "pattern" file.txt` |
| `sed`   | Stream editor for text transformation | `sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt` |
| `awk`   | Pattern scanning and text processing | `awk '{print $1}' file.txt` |
| `sort`  | Sort lines of text | `sort -n numbers.txt` |
| `uniq`  | Report or filter out repeated lines | `sort file.txt | uniq` |
| `wc`    | Count lines, words, and characters | `wc -l file.txt` |
| `cut`   | Remove sections from lines | `cut -d':' -f1 /etc/passwd` |
| `tr`    | Translate or delete characters | `echo "text" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'` |
| `paste` | Merge lines of files | `paste file1.txt file2.txt` |
| `join`  | Join lines on a common field | `join -t':' file1.txt file2.txt` |
| `tee`   | Read from stdin and write to stdout and files | `ls | tee files.txt` |

## Special Characters in Shell

Special characters have specific meanings in shell commands and scripting:

| Character | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `#`       | Comment | `# This is a comment` |
| `;`       | Command separator | `cmd1 ; cmd2` |
| `*`       | Wildcard (any string) | `ls *.txt` |
| `?`       | Wildcard (any single character) | `ls file?.txt` |
| `[]`      | Character class | `ls [a-c]*.txt` |
| `()`      | Command grouping | `(cd dir && ls)` |
| `{}`      | Brace expansion | `echo {1..5}` |
| `\`       | Escape character | `echo \*` |
| `'`       | Strong quotes (no interpretation) | `echo '$HOME'` |
| `"`       | Weak quotes (some interpretation) | `echo "$HOME"` |
| `$`       | Variable expansion | `echo $PATH` |
| `` ` ``   | Command substitution (old style) | `` echo `date` `` |
| `$()`     | Command substitution | `echo $(date)` |
| `~`       | Home directory | `cd ~/Documents` |
| `&`       | Background process | `command &` |
| `&&`      | Logical AND | `cmd1 && cmd2` |
| `||`      | Logical OR | `cmd1 || cmd2` |
| `!`       | Command history or logical NOT | `!ls` or `if [ ! -f file ]` |

## Escaping Special Characters

To use special characters literally (without their special meaning), you need to escape them using the backslash (`\`) or by enclosing them in single quotes:

```bash
# Using backslash
echo The price is \$5.00

# Using single quotes
echo 'The price is $5.00'
```

## Advanced Redirection Techniques

### Redirecting Both stdout and stderr

```bash
# Redirect both to the same file
command > file.txt 2>&1

# In Bash 4+
command &> file.txt

# Redirect to different files
command > output.txt 2> error.txt
```

### Using Here-Documents

Here-documents allow you to include multiline text directly in your script:

```bash
cat << EOF > file.txt
This is line 1
This is line 2
This is line 3
EOF
```

### Using Named Pipes (FIFOs)

Named pipes allow for interprocess communication:

```bash
mkfifo mypipe
command1 > mypipe &
command2 < mypipe
```
