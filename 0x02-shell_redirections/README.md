# Shell Redirections and Filters

This repository provides an introduction to shell redirections and filters in Unix-like operating systems.

## Overview

Shell redirections and filters are powerful features that allow you to manipulate input and output streams in the command line. Understanding how to redirect input and output, as well as apply filters to data, can enhance your productivity and enable advanced data processing.

## Redirections

Shell redirections enable you to redirect input and output streams to and from files, as well as connect multiple commands together. Here are some commonly used redirection operators:

- **`>`**: Redirects the output of a command to a file, overwriting the file if it exists.

- **`>>`**: Appends the output of a command to a file, preserving existing content.

- **`<`**: Redirects the input of a command from a file.

- **`|`**: Connects the output of one command as the input of another command, known as "piping."

For example, to save the output of a command to a file, you can use the `>` operator:

```
ls > files.txt
```

In this example, the `ls` command lists files and directories, and the output is redirected to the `files.txt` file.

## Filters

Filters are commands that process and transform input data. They take input from standard input (usually the keyboard or the output of another command) and produce output to standard output (usually the terminal or the input of another command).

Here are some commonly used filters:

- **`grep`**: Searches for lines in a file or input that match a specified pattern.

- **`sort`**: Sorts lines of text alphabetically or numerically.

- **`cut`**: Extracts specified columns or fields from input.

- **`sed`**: Stream editor for performing text transformations.

- **`awk`**: Powerful text processing tool for pattern scanning and processing.

For example, to find lines in a file that contain a specific word, you can use the `grep` filter:

```
grep "apple" fruits.txt
```

In this example, the `grep` command searches for lines in the `fruits.txt` file that contain the word "apple."

## Combining Redirections and Filters

You can combine redirections and filters to perform advanced data processing tasks. For example, you can use the output of one command as the input for another command by piping them together:

```
cat data.txt | grep "keyword" | sort > result.txt
```

In this example, the `cat` command outputs the content of `data.txt`, which is then piped to `grep` to filter lines containing the "keyword." Finally, the sorted output is redirected to the `result.txt` file.

## Conclusion

Shell redirections and filters are powerful tools for manipulating input and output streams in the command line. Understanding how to redirect input and output, as well as utilize filters, can greatly enhance your efficiency and enable advanced data processing tasks.
