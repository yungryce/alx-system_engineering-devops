## System Context
This component builds on web server configuration knowledge to introduce load balancing concepts, creating a more robust and scalable web infrastructure. Load balancing is a critical element in high-traffic web applications, allowing distribution of workload across multiple servers to prevent overloading, improve reliability, and enhance performance.

## Development Requirements
- Linux/Unix-based Operating System
- Multiple Web Servers (minimum two)
- HAProxy Load Balancer
- Nginx Web Server
- Text Editor (vi/vim/emacs)
- Shell Scripting Knowledge
- HTTP Protocol Understanding
- Basic Networking Concepts
- APT Package Management

## Development Workflow
1. Read project specifications and requirements
2. Set up and configure web servers with custom HTTP headers
3. Install and configure HAProxy load balancer
4. Configure round-robin algorithm for traffic distribution
5. Implement health checks for server monitoring
6. Test load balancer functionality and failover capabilities
7. Validate custom HTTP headers across server responses
8. Optimize configurations for performance
9. Document implementation details and configurations
10. Submit for automated and peer review

## Maintenance Notes
- All scripts use appropriate shebang lines
- Each script includes comments explaining functionality
- Scripts have proper execution permissions
- Server configurations follow security best practices
- HAProxy configuration focuses on reliability and performance
- Custom HTTP headers implemented consistently across servers
- Load balancer uses server health checks for reliability
- Scripts are idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)

## Implementation Specifics

### Web Server Configuration
- **Custom HTTP Headers**: [0-custom_http_response_header](./0-custom_http_response_header)
  * Installs and configures Nginx with custom HTTP header (X-Served-By)
  * Sets the server hostname as the header value for request tracking
  * Implements redirection and custom error pages
  * Ensures proper content for server responses

### Load Balancer Setup
- **HAProxy Configuration**: [1-install_load_balancer](./1-install_load_balancer)
  * Installs and configures HAProxy version 2.5
  * Implements round-robin load balancing algorithm
  * Sets up backend web servers with health checks
  * Configures frontend to accept HTTP traffic on port 80
  * Ensures HAProxy starts automatically on system boot
