- Apache Troubleshooting
- Server Response Analysis
- Server Log Analysis
- Systematic Debugging Process
- Root Cause Identification
- Shell Scripting for Server Configuration
- HTTP Protocol Understanding
- Problem-Solving Methodology
- Web Infrastructure Debugging

## System Context
This component introduces foundational skills in debugging web stacks, focusing on real-world scenarios where web servers malfunction in containerized environments. The debugging series progressively builds skills for diagnosing and fixing increasingly complex web infrastructure issues, which are essential for maintaining reliable web services.

## Development Requirements
- Linux/Unix-based Operating System
- Docker Engine
- curl Command-Line Tool
- Basic Understanding of Apache Configuration
- Text Editor (vi/vim/emacs)
- Shell Scripting Knowledge
- Access to Docker Hub for Container Images

## Development Workflow
1. Read project specifications and requirements
2. Start a malfunctioning Docker container
3. Identify symptoms of the web server issue
4. Analyze server logs and configuration files
5. Develop a hypothesis for the root cause
6. Implement a fix through shell commands or configuration changes
7. Validate the solution by testing server responses
8. Document the debugging process and solution
9. Submit for automated and peer review

## Maintenance Notes
- All scripts use appropriate shebang lines
- Each script includes a comment describing its functionality
- Scripts have proper execution permissions
- Solutions prioritize simplicity and minimal changes
- Fixes follow best practices for web server configuration
- Scripts are idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)
- Documentation clearly explains the issue and solution

## Implementation Specifics

### Apache Configuration Fix
- **Server Configuration**: [0-give_me_a_page](./0-give_me_a_page)
  * Fixes Apache configuration to properly serve web pages
  * Adds ServerName directive to resolve hostname issues
  * Ensures Apache service is running
